# Question
Build a browser-based notification system with the following features:
When the user clicks a button, a notification is triggered using the browserâ€™s native Web Notification API.
The system must allow a maximum of 5 active notifications. If a new notification is triggered after reaching the limit, the oldest notification should be closed.
If the browser does not support notifications or the user has denied notification permissions, the system should gracefully fallback to showing an in-app toast message instead.
The user should be able to enter a custom notification message and click a button to send it.
The UI should provide a "Clear All" option to dismiss all active notifications (both browser and toast).
